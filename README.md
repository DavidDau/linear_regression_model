# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction System
A comprehensive machine learning system for predicting cardiovascular disease risk, featuring data analysis, API backend, and Flutter mobile application.

## My Mission
To mitigate labor shortages and boost productivity by leveraging predictive analytics to identify and prevent cardio-related diseases early, ensuring a healthier workforce and a more resilient economy.
.

## Data Description & Source
This project predicts the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease based on various patient metrics such as age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. The dataset used is publicly available from the [Kaggle Cardiovascular Disease Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colewelkins/cardiovascular-disease).
